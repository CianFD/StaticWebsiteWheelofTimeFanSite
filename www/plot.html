			What follows is a long journey taking them from Two Rivers across the land to The Eye of the World, a blessed place in The Blight, a land tainted by evil. It is here that they make a stand against 2 of the Forsaken, ancient, powerful Aes Sedai who have been corrupted by Ba'alzamon, the Dark One, an ancient evil. The Forsaken are killed and Rand himself drives away Ba'alzamon, channeling the One Power, a feat no male has performed in hundreds of years as along men who do so will go insane. They also recover the Banner of the ancient hero/villain, The Dragon and the legendary Horn of Valere, which when blown will resurrect dead heroes to fight on the side of the one who blew it.</p>

			The party recover in nearby Fal Dara are the showdown in the Eye. While there, Darkfriends invade the city, killing guards and stealing the Horn. Meanwhile the Head of the Aes Sedai, The Amyrlin Seat meets the party to learn of the events at the Eye. It is here she reveals that Rand is the Dragon Reborn, and his actions will either save or destroy the world. Rand, Mat, Perrin, Loial and a number of Fal Dara Soldiers are tasked with hunting the Darkfriends, and retrieving the Horn. Meanwhile Egwene and Nynave will travel with the Amyrlin Seat back to Tar Valon to begin training to become Aes Sedai.
			<br>
			<br>
			While in Tar Valon the women learn of the Black Ajah, a sect of Aes Sedai who have defected to follow Ba'alzamon and are acting as double agents in The White Tower. An Aes Sedai tasks them with coming with her to gather intel at Toman Head of the Black Ajah. She then reveals herself to be a Black Ajah, betraying them and they're taken into slavery by a sect called the Seanchan.
			<br>
			<br>
			Rand & co. reach Toman Head leading to a battle against the Seanchan, the Darkfriends and a fanatical group called the The Children of the Light. The women free themselves and join the battle. Mat blows the horn ressurecting the dead heroes to fight for them and they successfully defeat the other factions. Rand again battles Ba'alzamon and seems to kill him but in doing so he reveals himself as the Dragon Reborn to the world.</p>

			Rand, wishing to keep his friends safe and prove himself as the Dragon Reborn, sets off on his own towards Tear to claim the magical sword, Callandor. With this sword and his waning sanity he may "break the world". Moiraine, Lan, Perrin and followers of the Dragon follow Rand to try protect him but he continues to evade them.
			<br>
			<br>
			Egwene, Nynaeve and the Daughter-Heir of Andor, Elayne, return to Tar Valon, to be both rewarded by being promoted to the rank of Accepted as Aes Sedai, while also punished for abandoning their post as Novices. The Amyrlin Seat tasks them with determining if any other Black Ajah are currently in The White Tower. They determine 13 Black Ajah have defected and set a trap for them and Rand at The Heart of Stone in Tear. They travel to Tear to attempt to capture them.
			<br>
			<br>
			Mat is recovering in Tar Valon after the Aes Sedai break the bond he had with the cursed dagger. He then travels to Caemlyn to deliver a letter from Elayne to her mother, Queen Morgase. On the way he links back up with Thom. They determine to travel to Tear to protect Egwene & co. as he realises they're walking into a trap.
			<br>
			<br>
			The Black Ajah and a Forsaken spring their trap in the Stone of Tear, along with Ba'alzamon. Egwene & co. fall into their trap but are rescued by Mat. Moiraine kills the Forsaken with forbidden magic. Rand manages to take Callandor and kills Ba'alzamon but it's a trick as Ba'alzamon is revealed not to be human.
